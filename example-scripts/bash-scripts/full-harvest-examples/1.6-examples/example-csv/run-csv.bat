REM 	If the deb file was used to install the harvester then the
REM 	directory should be set to /usr/share/vivo/harvester which is the
REM 	current location associated with the deb installation.
REM 	Since it is also possible the harvester was installed by
REM 	uncompressing the tar.gz the setting is available to be changed
REM 	and should agree with the installation location

REM  Supply the location of the detailed log file which is generated during the script.
REM 	If there is an issue with a harvest, this file proves invaluable in finding
REM 	a solution to the problem. It has become common practice in addressing a problem
REM 	to request this file. The passwords and usernames are filtered out of this file
REM 	to prevent these logs from containing sensitive information.
echo Full Logging in %HARVEST_NAME%.%TODAY%.log 

IF not exist logs (
  mkdir logs
)
REM clear old data
REM  For a fresh harvest, the removal of the previous information maintains data integrity.
REM 	If you are continuing a partial run or wish to use the old and already retrieved
REM 	data, you will want to comment out this line since it could prevent you from having
REM  	the required harvest data.  


IF exist data (
  rmdir /s /q data

REM  Copy CSV to JDBC
echo Copy CSV to JDBC
@java %HARVESTER_JAVA_OPTS% -cp %CLASSPATH% org.vivoweb.harvester.util.CSVtoJDBC -X csvtojdbc.config.xml
if %errorlevel% neq 0 exit /b %errorlevel%


REM  Execute Fetch
REM  This stage of the script is where the information is gathered together into one local
REM 	place to facilitate the further steps of the harvest. The data is stored locally
REM 	in a format based off of the source. The format is a form of RDF but not in the VIVO ontology
echo Fetch from JDBC
@java %HARVESTER_JAVA_OPTS% -cp %CLASSPATH% org.vivoweb.harvester.fetch.JDBCFetch -X jdbcfetch.config.xml
if %errorlevel% neq 0 exit /b %errorlevel%


REM  Execute Translate
REM  This is the part of the script where the input data is transformed into valid RDF
REM    Translate will apply an xslt file to the fetched data which will result in the data 
REM    becoming valid RDF in the VIVO ontology
echo Translate data to valid RDF

REM  Execute Transfer to import from record handler into local temp model
REM  From this stage on the script places the data into a Jena model. A model is a
REM 	data storage structure similar to a database, but in RDF.
REM  The harvester tool Transfer is used to move/add/remove/dump data in models.
echo Transfer RDF into temporary triple store

REM  Execute People Scoring and Matching
REM  In the scoring phase the data in the harvest is compared to the data within Vivo and a new model
REM  	is created with the values / scores of the data comparisons.
REM  We execute scores in 2 different steps, known as "tiered scoring". The initial score limits our input set to speed up performance 
echo Score people
@java %HARVESTER_JAVA_OPTS% -cp %CLASSPATH% org.vivoweb.harvester.score.Score -X score-people.config.xml

if %errorlevel% neq 0 exit /b %errorlevel%

REM  Find matches using scores and rename nodes to matching uri
REM  Using the data model created by the score phase, the match process changes the harvested uris for
REM  	comparison values above the chosen threshold within the xml configuration file.
echo Match People and Departments
@java %HARVESTER_JAVA_OPTS% -cp %CLASSPATH% org.vivoweb.harvester.score.Match -X match-people-departments.config.xml
if %errorlevel% neq 0 exit /b %errorlevel%

REM  Execute ChangeNamespace to get unmatched events into current namespace
REM  This is where the new people from the harvest are given uris within the namespace of Vivo
REM  	If there is an issue with uris being in another namespace after import, make sure this step
REM    was completed for those uris.
echo Changenamespace on People

REM  This is where the new vcards from the harvest are given uris within the namespace of Vivo
echo Changenamespace on vcards

REM  Perform an update
REM  The harvester maintains copies of previous harvests in order to perform the same harvest twice
REM    but only add the new statements, while removing the old statements that are no longer
REM    contained in the input data. This is done in several steps of finding the old statements,
REM    then the new statements, and then applying them to the Vivo main model.

REM  Find Subtractions
REM  When making the previous harvest model agree with the current harvest, the statements that exist in
REM 	the previous harvest but not in the current harvest need to be identified for removal.
echo Find Subtractions
@java %HARVESTER_JAVA_OPTS% -cp %CLASSPATH% org.vivoweb.harvester.diff.Diff -X diff-subtractions.config.xml
if %errorlevel% neq 0 exit /b %errorlevel%

REM  Find Additions
REM  When making the previous harvest model agree with the current harvest, the statements that exist in
REM 	the current harvest but not in the previous harvest need to be identified for addition.
echo Find Additions

if %errorlevel% neq 0 exit /b %errorlevel%

REM  Apply Subtractions to Previous model
echo Apply Subtractions to Previous model

REM  Now that the changes have been applied to the previous harvest and the harvested data in vivo
REM 	agree with the previous harvest, the changes are now applied to the vivo model.
